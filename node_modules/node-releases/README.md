# Node.js releases data

All data is located in `data` directory.

`data/raw` contains raw data `nodejs.json` and `iojs.json`.

`data/processed` contains `envs.js` with both node.js and io.js data preprocessed to be used by [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) and other projects. Each version in this file contains only necessary info: version, release date and optionally LTS flag.

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save node-releases

## Updating data
```bash
npm run build
